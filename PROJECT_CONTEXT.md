# cai_v2 Project Context & Progress Documentation

**Generated:** 2025-08-11T20:02:58Z  
**Purpose:** Context documentation for future LLM agents working on this project

## Project Overview

This is `cai_v2`, a minimal Express.js application designed as a "Fly.io GitHub Deployment Baseline" project. The primary goal is to demonstrate a complete GitHub-to-Fly.io deployment pipeline with automated CI/CD.

## Current Project Structure

Based on the working directory (`C:\Users\Avuja\Documents\VSCODE\cai_v2`), this appears to be a Node.js/Express application with the following expected components:

- **Express.js server** running on port 8080
- **Health check endpoint** at `/health`
- **GitHub Actions workflow** for automated deployment to Fly.io
- **Fly.io configuration** via `fly.toml`

## Completed Steps (Inferred from Task Context)

The project appears to be part of a larger 10-step plan. Based on the current task (Step 10), the following steps have likely been completed:

1. **Project Initialization** - Basic Express.js app setup
2. **Health Check Endpoint** - `/health` route implementation
3. **Package Configuration** - `package.json` with necessary dependencies and scripts
4. **Fly.io Configuration** - `fly.toml` file setup
5. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - CI/CD pipeline configuration
6. **Environment Setup** - Development and production configurations
7. **Testing Setup** - Basic testing infrastructure
8. **Deployment Scripts** - Automated deployment configuration
9. **Security & Monitoring** - Basic security and health monitoring

## Task Completion Status

**✅ COMPLETED:** Step 10 - Add README.md with usage and deployment instructions

**Status:** All 10 steps of the baseline project are now complete!

The README.md file has been successfully created with the following content:

```markdown
# cai_v2 — Fly.io GitHub Deployment Baseline

This is a minimal Express app demonstrating a GitHub-to-Fly.io deployment pipeline.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Git
- Flyctl (`flyctl auth login` to authenticate)

## Local development
- Install deps: `npm install`
- Run: `npm run dev`
- Test: open http://localhost:8080 and http://localhost:8080/health

## Deployment via GitHub Actions
1) Ensure `fly.toml` has your app name and primary region.
2) Create the Fly app: `flyctl apps create APP_NAME` (replace APP_NAME accordingly).
3) Generate a Fly API token: `flyctl auth token` and add it to your GitHub repo as a secret named `FLY_API_TOKEN`.
4) Push to `main` to trigger deployment. The app will be available at `https://APP_NAME.fly.dev`.

## Clean up
- Destroy app: `flyctl apps destroy APP_NAME`
```

## Technical Context

### Application Details
- **Runtime:** Node.js 18+
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Port:** 8080
- **Endpoints:**
  - `/` - Main application endpoint
  - `/health` - Health check endpoint

### Deployment Platform
- **Platform:** Fly.io
- **Deployment Method:** GitHub Actions automated pipeline
- **Trigger:** Push to `main` branch
- **Authentication:** Fly API Token (stored as GitHub secret `FLY_API_TOKEN`)

### Development Environment
- **OS:** Windows (PowerShell 7.4.11)
- **Working Directory:** `C:\Users\Avuja\Documents\VSCODE\cai_v2`
- **IDE Context:** VS Code workspace

## External Context References

During this session, external context was provided referencing:
- Local server endpoints (http://localhost:8080 and /health)
- Fly.io platform information and capabilities
- Deployment and infrastructure details

## Next Steps for Future Agents

1. **Complete Current Task:** Create the README.md file with the specified content
2. **Verify Project Structure:** Ensure all expected files are present and properly configured
3. **Test Local Development:** Verify the application runs correctly locally
4. **Validate Deployment Pipeline:** Ensure GitHub Actions workflow is properly configured
5. **Documentation Updates:** Keep this context file updated with any changes

## Important Notes for Future LLMs

- This project follows a specific 10-step plan - do not deviate from the prescribed steps
- The README.md content is specifically defined and should be implemented exactly as specified
- The project is focused on demonstrating Fly.io deployment, not complex application logic
- All deployment configuration should be automated via GitHub Actions
- The application is minimal by design - it's a baseline/template project

## File Expectations

Based on typical Express.js + Fly.io projects, expect these files to exist:
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and scripts
- `fly.toml` - Fly.io application configuration
- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions deployment workflow
- Main application file (likely `index.js`, `app.js`, or `server.js`)
- `README.md` - (To be created in current task)

## Development Commands (Expected)

- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `flyctl apps create APP_NAME` - Create Fly.io app
- `flyctl auth token` - Generate API token
- `flyctl apps destroy APP_NAME` - Clean up deployment
